# Engineering Handbook

Welcome to the **Talents Mapping Engineering Hub**.

This documentation serves as the **single source of truth** for the Talents Mapping platform's technical ecosystem. It is designed to guide engineers through the architectural vision, migration strategies, and implementation standards for the **2026 Transformation**.

## Documentation Landscape

The documentation is structured to support the full engineering lifecycle:

### 🏗️ Architecture & Design
*Core blueprints and decision records driving the platform's evolution.*
- **[Blueprint](../02-architecture/01-blueprint.md)**: The strategic technical vision for 2026.
- **[System Design](../02-architecture/07-system-design.md)**: Component interactions and data flow.
- **[Functional Specs](../02-architecture/05-functional-specs.md)**: Detailed feature logic and requirements.

### ⚙️ Backend & Core
*Server-side logic, database schemas, and data integrity.*
- **[Database Schema](../03-backend/01-database-schema.md)**: Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) and models. *(Coming Soon)*
- **[Legacy Compatibility](../03-backend/02-legacy-database.md)**: Handling historical data and deprecation paths. *(Coming Soon)*

### 🖥️ Frontend & Client
*User interfaces, report generation, and client-side interactivity.*
- **[Reports Engine](../04-frontend/01-reports.md)**: Logic behind PDF generation and visualization. *(Coming Soon)*

### 🚀 Infrastructure & API
*Deployment, connectivity, and external interfaces.*
- **[API Reference](../05-api-reference/intro.md)**: Endpoints for authentication, commerce, and assessments. *(Coming Soon)*
- **[Deployment](../06-deployment/01-infrastructure.md)**: CI/CD pipelines and server provisioning. *(Coming Soon)*

## Contribution Standards

To maintain engineering excellence, all documentation contributions must adhere to our standardized templates:

- **[Feature Specification](../templates/feature-spec.md)**
- **[API Endpoint Definition](../templates/api-endpoint.md)**
- **[Database Schema Change](../templates/db-schema.md)**
